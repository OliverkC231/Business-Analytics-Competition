OECD social spending definition

The OECD defines social spending as the provision by public or private agencies of benefits to, and financial contributions targeted at, households and individuals in order to provide support during circumstances which adversely affect their welfare (Adema and Fron, 2019[2]). The range of social purposes addressed by policies captured in SOCX include:

         Old age and Survivors (e.g. pension payments),
         Incapacity-related benefits (e.g. disability-related payments, sick-pay),
         Health (e.g. medical goods and services),
         Family (e.g. child allowances, paid parental leave),
         Active Labour Market Policies (e.g. employment services),
         Unemployment (e.g. unemployment compensation),
         Housing (e.g. housing allowances),
         Other Contingencies (e.g. social assistance type benefits to low-income households).
